# esx_adrp_vehicle

ESX ADRP Vehicle Managment developed by Hawaii Beach initially for ADRP. Releasing this because I got kicked out and they no longer seem to use half the code, so at least someone can still enjoy it!

## Features

- Vehicle managment system, meaning you can lock your vehicle whilst standing close to it (default key bind `U`)
- Trunk system (default key bind `G`) where you can store weapons (doesn't support tints), accounts (ESX) and of course regular items
- Key chain (you will have to trigger `esx_adrp_vehicle:openKeyChainMenu` somehow to access) where you can manage your vehicle keys, and ability to delete & give keys - keys are required in order to toggle an vehicle lock
- Top notch server sided code, so no flaws to be discovered (right?)

Should be noted that this resource was never updated to use the new ESX weight system and has its own weight math. Vehicle max capacity is class based which also is a bad design so that code should also be discarded - but hey that's something you can improve on.. right?
